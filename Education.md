One of my biggest passions is studying Finance and Economics. First off, studying global markets is a fascinating field. It is intruiging to see how global markets react to different kinds of political events, economic conditions, and other factors that influence market behavior. 

In additon to following global markets, I have always been drawn to financial crises. From the Great Depression to the Subprime Mortgage Crises, understanding these causes and effects, can provide a better perspective on how to improve our financial systems. 

Finally, Finance and Economics are always evolving. There are new theories, technologies, and products emerging all of the time. This keeps me motivated and eager to learn and improve my financial knowledge and skillset.
